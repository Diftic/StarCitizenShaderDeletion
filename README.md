This program attempts to delete shaders built while playing Star Citizen, in order to improve low ingame FPS caused by corrupted shader files.
It will track down and delete files from the standard shader temp folders, only leaving behind what is currently in use by the system.
It is therefor imperative that all rendering software and games be closed upon running this program.
